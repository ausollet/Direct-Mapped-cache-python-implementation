# Direct-Mapped-cache-python-implementation

## About project:
Implementaion of direct mapped cache with 256 lines and varying word size (1->16) using python, where each word is of 32 bits size.

## Aim:
To observe and study the change in hit ratio for differing conditions such as number of words per line, number of lines, number of instructions.
